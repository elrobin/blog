    "text": "Image generated with DALL-E\n\n\nLately I am very interested on authorship and more specifically, on the problems this concept brings in terms of allocation of credit among researchers given the current collaborative nature of research. This is very much related to the book I am writing on diversity and recognition in academia.\nHere some notes for some of the papers I am reading.\nCronin, B. (2001). Hyperauthorship: A postmodern perversion or evidence of a structural shift in scholarly communication practices? Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 52(7), 558–569. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.1097\nHe focuses on the issues arising in biomedical sciences with regard to honorary authorship and authorship inflation. Takes a historical perspective, from the birth of scientific authorship to the development of the current scientific publishing system. It discusses disciplinary differences on authorship order. Authorship is tied to credit and responsibility, but also is linked with an individualistic notion and not a collective endeavour which is an anachronistic conception of science.\nCollaboration becomes a reality especially after WWII, with the expansion of ‘big science’ which required funding, infrastructure and coordination and management. Currently it is the norm, with some fields and projects requiring the development of an internal structure and division of labour while others are more informal levels of collaboration. He mentions the suggestion by (Rennie, Yank, and Emanuel 1997) of abandoning the concept of author in favour of alternatives such as contributor or guarantor. As we know this proposal later gained track within the biomedical sciences with the CRediT taxonomy becoming a NISO standard more than 15 years later (Allen et al. 2014). This has to do with the inefficacy of the initial solution proposed by ICMJE which was to make all authors responsible of the complete content of a paper.\nStill, Cronin is critical with this proposal because it is still difficult to enforce responsibility in cases of what he terms hyperauthorship. He entertains the idea of using the ‘Acknowledgements’ section for contributions of second order, but recognizes also its limitations. Finally, he discusses the HEP model where all the recognition and authorship discussions are ridden internally, while an external observer would be incapable of administrating credit through authorship.\nWalsh, J. P., & Lee, Y.-N. (2015). The bureaucratization of science. Research Policy, 44(8), 1584–1600. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2015.04.010\nThis paper examines how scientific teams organize internally based on their size, interdisciplinarity and task interdependence. It uses organizational theory (similarly to (Whitley 2000)) and emphasizes the importance of internal structure to ensure a successful performance. They make some interesting points, such as the changes on the training model of scientists from the apprentice-model kind of model suggested by (Laudel and Gläser 2008) (although not cited in the paper) to an industrialized model of scientific careers with more of a professor-employer kind of model. Again they bring up the misalignment between credit allocation and multiauthorship.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAllen, Liz, Jo Scott, Amy Brand, Marjorie Hlava, and Micah Altman. 2014. “Publishing: Credit Where Credit Is Due.” Nature 508 (7496): 312–13. https://doi.org/10.1038/508312a.\n\n\nLaudel, Grit, and Jochen Gläser. 2008. “From Apprentice to Colleague: The Metamorphosis of Early Career Researchers.” Higher Education 55 (3): 387–406. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-007-9063-7.\n\n\nRennie, Drummond, Veronica Yank, and Linda Emanuel. 1997. “When Authorship Fails: A Proposal to Make Contributors Accountable.” JAMA 278 (7): 579–85. https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1997.03550070071041.\n\n\nWhitley, Richard. 2000.

    "text": "Illustration from Davis Parkins, Source: Nature\n\n\nNotes from Biagioli, M. (2013). Rights or Rewards? Changing Frameworks of Scientific Authorship. In M. Biagioli & P. Gallison (eds) Scientific Authorship: Credit and Intellectual Property in Science (1st ed., pp. 253-279). Routledge.\n\nScientific authorship is a misnomer, a historical vestige. Mario Biagioli, p. 274\n\nThe problems derived from using authorship as an attribution of credit in times of Big Science are a common issue for those studying the social dynamics of science through the use of publications. Authorship and author order are extremely polluted by seniority and power dynamics, furthermore, authorship seems a limited concept for reflecting each author’s contribution and responsibility, especially when dealing with papers produced by large teams.\nScientific authorship is considered a symbolic reward not attached to the specific object (the article) but to the true claims made in such object, and it is given by peers. This means that “a scientific claim does not count as such unless it is made public and subjected to peer evaluation” (p. 254). Multiauthorship includes a layer of complexity to the evaluation of scientific performance, as it introduces ambiguity: evaluators have to assess the value of the paper and the share of such value attributed to the candidate. “[T]he economy of science is inherently based on trust” (p. 260). The author argues that copyright does not hold for our understanding of scientific author and hence proposes a redefinition.\nHe revises how two different fields approached to this issue. The first one is the biomedical sciences. IMCJE’s first solution to this issue, was to reinforce the figure of the author in the traditional sense, which does not work in highly stratified science formed by dozens or even hundreds of authors. Hence it moved towards the concept of contributorship, where team members indicate their specific contribution to a given output, with the order of contributors reflecting the importance of such contribution. One of those contributors would play the role of the guarantor, that is, the person(s) who is responsible for overseeing the whole study and coordinating.\nThe second approach comes from high energy physics, instead of approaching authorship as a matter of responsibility and ownership, it considers it a matter of labour recognition. There is a Standard Author List for all people who have contributed in any way to a given lab or research centre, regardless of their involvement on specific papers or projects, and they appear alphabetically. To be part of this list, researchers have to compromise a share of their time and work, and this list is updated biannually by a committee. Furthermore, leaves of absence are allowed of up to a year without meaning being removed from the list, and researchers are even recognized a year after being removed from the list, as a way to recognize that contributions can be direct or indirect and are cumulative. In this second setting, authorship does not have the same value or credit as in biomedical sciences, and prestige and recognition operate differently through recommendation letters and internal dynamics and correspondence.\nThe review process in high energy physics operates in a different way to what we know from other fields. After a subgroup from the Standard Author List writes up a manuscript, it is submitted internally to all members of the list, who are asked to comment electronically. The paper goes three rounds of internal reviews and then, members of the list who still disagree with the contents, remove their name from the manuscript, hence here less authors would equate to less acceptance. As all the validation process is internal, so are issues with research integrity, fraud or misconduct.\nHence, Biagioli concludes indicating that scientific authorship is a tied more to disciplinary ecologies and the economy of science rather than to a legal category, more related with responsibility and disciplinary norms."

In this paper we use the largest dataset (to my knowledge) on contribution statements based on Scopus data, with over 650,000 publications, and try to explore empirically Richard Whitley’s concept of task uncertainty (Whitley 2000) and the distribution of labour across fields. We do this by computing two indicators:\n\nTask entropy, which reflects the (un)balance on the distribution of tasks among authors.\nTask specialization, which looks into the average distance of the authors task profile, based on the grouping of contributions into three groups: technical tasks, conceptual tasks and management tasks.\n\nOur preliminary findings suggest a relation between team size and task uncertainty, identifying 3 types of research teams based on the balance of the task distribution: small collaboration (2-8 authors), which is the most common type of team (~85%), functional teams (9-29 authors) and super teams (30+ authors). From what we’ve seen based on our approach (probably needs more refinement) disciplines do not play a big role on differences on task uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🗒️Check the slides here to learn more about our work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWhitley, Richard. 2000.

    "text": "Last Tuesday I taught the 3rd session of the course ‘Cómo escribir y publicar artículos científicos en Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades’. This is a course I have taught for several years along with my colleagues Daniel Torres-Salinas and Evaristo Jiménez-Contreras. We normally end up switching sessions based on availability and tend to change contents on the fly, but this time we went for organization and method, and Dani created a nice layout which followed a sensible workflow (you can have a look at it at the end of the post, all in Spanish).\nI was in charge of Session III and I took the baton and decided to also be methodic, and developed the following materials.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Napoli recently won its 4th Scudetto and of course, the city was a big party\n\n\nLast Monday I had the chance to participate as an invited speaker in the I International Edition of the Summer School in Science Mapping organized by research team led by Massimo Aria and Corrado Cuccurullo. These are the people behind the wonderful R package Bibliometrix, and now also TaLL (for text analysis). It is a really nice and smart group of people, doing a fantastic job on the development of tools that can be used both, for people with and w/o programming skills. I have been in touch with them for several years, as we have invited them in several occasions to the ESSS to introduce students to their software, and even Dani created a videotutorial in Spanish for the Biblioshiny interface and I’ve used it for my teaching.\nIn this occasion I was invited to talk about Altmetrics and Open Science, based on previous lectures I periodically give at the ESSS. I took the occasion to improve my materials, update them and improve the narrative. The lecture went well with an interesting follow up given the multidisciplinary background of the students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the slides here"
