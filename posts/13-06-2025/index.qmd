Last Monday I had the chance to participate as an invited speaker in the I International Edition of the [**Summer School in Science Mapping**](https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/index.php/school/sssm-2025/sssm2023-description) organized by research team led by Massimo Aria and Corrado Cuccurullo. These are the people behind the wonderful R package [Bibliometrix](https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/index.php), and now also [TaLL](https://github.com/massimoaria/tall) (for text analysis). It is a really nice and smart group of people, doing a fantastic job on the development of tools that can be used both, for people with and w/o programming skills. I have been in touch with them for several years, as we have invited them in several occasions to the ESSS to introduce students to their software, and even Dani created a [videotutorial in Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoRcJg15XVA) for the Biblioshiny interface and I've used it for my [teaching](https://zenodo.org/records/7556999).

In this occasion I was invited to talk about **Altmetrics and Open Science**, based on previous lectures I periodically give at the ESSS. I took the occasion to improve my materials, update them and improve the narrative. The lecture went well with an interesting follow up given the multidisciplinary background of the students.
